# Project Overview
This project involved several tasks related to evaluating the effectiveness of Capomulin, a drug of interest for Pymaceuticals, Inc., in treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The analysis aimed to compare Capomulin's performance against other treatment regimens for SCC using data from a comprehensive animal study.

# Project Structure
The project components and tasks completed are outlined below:

1. **Data Preparation**: Merged the mouse metadata and study results into a single DataFrame, cleaned the data, and removed any duplicate entries.

2. **Generate Summary Statistics**: Calculated summary statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volumes for each drug regimen.

3. **Create Visualizations**: Generated bar charts, pie charts, box plots, line plots, and scatter plots to visualize various aspects of the study data.

4. **Quartiles, Outliers, and Box Plot**: Calculated quartiles, identified outliers, and created a box plot to visualize the distribution of final tumor volumes for selected treatment regimens.

5. **Correlation and Regression**: Conducted correlation and regression analysis to understand the relationship between mouse weight and observed tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
